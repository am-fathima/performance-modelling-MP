This project analyzes and models the performance of a monthly clinic using a queueing theory approach. The focus is on understanding how the number of available doctors affects average patient waiting time, system utilization, and overall service efficiency. The goal is to minimize patient waiting time while maintaining optimal resource usage.
Primary Objective: Minimize average patient waiting time in the ER.
By adjusting the number of doctors and analyzing queue dynamics, we aim to identify an efficient configuration that balances workload and service quality.
